## Game Rules
You will be given a result of a secret equation which works on BODMAS rules. You have to guess the equation.
## Example 
Assume you are given 6. Now you have to guess the equation where the result is 6. Let me guess it as 2*3+0. If my guessed equation is correct with the secret equation then you will won the game. Otherwise you will get a chance to know that the numbers and symbols you entered are present or not in the equation. They will be colored. Each color has an indication 
1. Green - Symbol or number is in the correct position. 
2. Orange indicates wrong position but present in the secret equation. 
3. No change in color/Grey indicates the the symbol/numbers are not the part of secret eqation. In this way you have to guess the correct eqation and you will win the game but unfortunately if you lost the game then you will be able to see the equation.
